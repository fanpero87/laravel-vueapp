# Basic WebApp using Vue

Click [here](https://blog.pusher.com/why-vuejs-laravel/) to watch the tutorial I used for this app

* The first part of the guide is just to explain how to put data into the HTML using vue
* The second part is to create an SPA (Single Page Application)

Install Vue to the Project
```
composer require laravel/ui
php artisan ui vue
npm install
npm run dev 
npm run watch
```

A user would only have to load once and fetch everything after by making API calls.
To do this, we need to install `Vue-router`
```
npm install vue-router
```
