## Basic WebApp using Vue

Click [here](https://blog.pusher.com/why-vuejs-laravel/) to check the tutorial that I used for this app.

# Install Vue to the Project
Run:
*-> composer require laravel/ui
*-> php artisan ui vue
*-> npm install
*-> npm run dev ==> you have to run this two times
*-> npm run watch

The first part of the guide is just to explain how to put data into the Html using vue.
On the second part, the idea is to create a SPA(Single Page Application)
A user would only have to load once and fetch everything after by making API calls.
TO do this, we need to install Vue-router.
*-> npm install vue-router
